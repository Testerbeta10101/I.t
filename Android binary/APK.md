# APK FILE


APK (Android Packeage kit)


It's the file format that Android uses for installing apps and other stuffs with it. 


An APK is an archive file, meaning that it contains multiple files, plus some metadata about them. You're probably familiar with other types of archive files, [[ZIP]], [[RAR]]

 Most files you can compress them to save space. And when  archive is used to distribute software, it's then called a software package.


APK is a different form of.JAR FILE (Java archive) file format, since a lot of ==Android is built in java==. All APK are [[ZIP]] files at their core, but they must contain additional information to properly function as an APK. So all APKS are [[ZIP]] are APKs.

When you open an APK on your Android device, it contains the instructions to install the app on your phone and provides information about the package itself to your device.

Normally, when you visit Google Play to download or update an app, the store automatically installs the APK for you. In this way, the Play Store also acts as a package managerâ€”a tool for easily installing, updating, and removing software on a device.

However, due to Android's open nature, Google Play is not the only way to find and install APKs. It's easy to obtain an APK file from elsewhere, move it to your device, and install it manually. See how to side-load apps on Android for a full guide.


## How Are APK FIles Created?

When a developer create and Android app, they likely use Android Studio, the offical development tool for Android. Once the app is ready to ship, Android Studio compiles the app, then puts it all into one container -an APK



APKs can have any name, but typically need to keep the file extenstion .apk so OSes know how to interpret them. When you download an APK, you'll usually find they have filename like the following.

```
com_google.android.dialer_66.0.374464850.apk
```


This is a (shortended ) version of the APK for Google's Phone. You can see that the full app name matches up with the app's filename in the URL of its Google Play page.


```https://google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.anddroid.dialer
```


The numbers at the end represent the current version, which can be quite granular since major apps like this are updated all the time.



## Why would I install APk FIles Manually?

Google play is fine for most people's Android installation needs, but there are sereral benefits to installing APKS manually

One of the biggest is getting acces to the latest version of apps ahead of time. When a major Google app (like calendar ) releases a major update, it can taek aweek or more for your device to get the latest release from Google Play. Installing the APK on your own lets you skip the wait and updateas soon as you want. ![APKMirror Download Android](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/APKMirror-Download-Android.png) ![Open Downloaded APK Android](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Open-Downloaded-APK-Android.png) ![Android Install Sideloaded App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Android-Install-Sideloaded-App.png)

Sideloading APKS also lets you install app on your device that aren't available on Google Play. You might find an app that isn't allowed on Google Play because it violates a poily, or maybe you want to test your friend's app that's currently in development.

Just like desktop software, though, downloading APK files from random websire can be dangerous while google play has filter in places to catch dangerous apps, there's not as much protection when you're installing apks on your own. They could be malware disguised as a legitmate app, or might be tamperd with to include spyware.

Only download APKs from trusted sites. Be wary of any page that promise you a paid app for free - that's a common tactic to install malware on your device.
