## Application Layer

The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. IT provide protocols that allow software to send receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few example of application layer protocols are the hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple main Transfer Protocol (SMTP), ans Domain name system (DNS).
