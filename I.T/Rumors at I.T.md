There is two people that is doing some type of revenge probably at the senior year. 

One kid that able to bypass chromebook security by using "3d view" or some chrome extension.

An this sense of thing this can be trace if the student is Sign in to their chromebook.

The other kid is using a USB Killer and using on teacher, imac 2013,2017,2020.

To my conclusion. I'm expecting some senior prank or revenge.
