# What is a RAR FIle?

RAR files are compressed file (s) or data containers that can be created using WinRAR. They can hold one or more files or folders and can compress, open and encrypt RAR and ZIP files.

RAR is the native format of the WinRAR Archiver.

WinRAR is the Windows version of RAR and includes the shell mode version or Graphical User Interface (GUI), as well as the command line option.

After you receive or download a RAR file from the Internet or via email, you need to extract its contents in order to use them. This can be done in 2 simple steps:

Double-click on the file and it will be displayed in WinRAR. You can then select which files or folders you want to extract/open.
Click the "Extract To" icon at the top of the WinRAR window, choose the destination folder (the folder where you want to store the RAR file) and click OK.
You will find the extracted file (s) in the destination folder where you saved them.
